== Load Balancing Algorithms
The load balancing algorithm that is used determines which server, in a backend, will be selected when load balancing.

=== roundrobin
Round Robin selects servers in turns. This is the default algorithm.

=== leastconn
Selects the server with the least number of connections--it is recommended for longer sessions. Servers in the same backend are also rotated in a round-robin fashion.

=== source
This selects which server to use based on a hash of the source IP i.e. your user's IP address. This is one method to ensure that a user will connect to the same server.
